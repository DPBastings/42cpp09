This module should be completed within the following constraints:

1. Every exercise should be completed using one single C++ standard library
container (barring exercise 02, which uses two containers).
2. No container may be used more than once between all exercises.

With this in mind, I've paired every module with a container as follows:
* ex00 (BTC):		`std::vector`;
* ex01 (RPN):		`std::deque`;
* ex02 (PmergeMe):	`std::forward\_list` and `std::list`.
