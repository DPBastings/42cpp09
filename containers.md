This module should be completed within the following constraints:

1. Every exercise should be completed using one single C++ standard library
container (barring exercise 02, which uses two containers).
2. No container may be used more than once.

With this in mind, I've paired every module with a container as follows:
* ex00 (BTC):		std::vector;
* ex01 (RPN):		std::array;
* ex02 (PmergeMe):	std::deque and std::forward\_list
